# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Sanctum Media** (“the Bot,” “we,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when the Bot is used within Discord servers.

By adding or interacting with Sanctum Media, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Sanctum Media is designed to function with minimal data collection.  
We may temporarily process the following limited information to perform bot functions:

- **Discord server and channel identifiers** (IDs) – to determine where and how to deliver messages or alerts.
- **User identifiers** – when required for moderation commands, event triggers, or internal logging.
- **Message content or status data** – only when necessary to generate automated responses, such as service status or maintenance announcements.

No personally identifiable information (such as email addresses, IP addresses, or device data) is collected, stored, or shared.

---

## 2. Data Storage and Retention

Sanctum Media does **not** maintain a permanent database.  
Any processed data (such as message content, IDs, or timestamps) is stored **temporarily in memory** for the duration of a task and discarded immediately afterward.

No persistent storage, analytics, or user profiling occurs.

---

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Sanctum Media does not share, sell, or distribute data to any third parties.  
Limited information may be processed by Discord’s systems as part of normal bot operation in accordance with [Discord’s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

We do not integrate with external advertising, analytics, or tracking services.

---

## 4. Security

Reasonable technical measures are in place to protect data handled by Sanctum Media.  
While no system is perfectly secure, we make a best effort to ensure that temporary data handling occurs safely and within the scope of Discord’s platform permissions.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Sanctum Media operates entirely within the Discord platform and does not directly connect to outside APIs except for self-hosted monitoring or alerting systems operated by the maintainers of Sanctum Media.  
These systems are not used for advertising or user tracking.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Since Sanctum Media does not store any user data, there is no retained information to request, modify, or delete.  
If you believe the Bot is behaving unexpectedly or collecting data improperly, you may remove it from your server at any time.

---

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect new features or legal requirements.  
The “Last Updated” date above will always indicate the latest revision. Continued use of the Bot after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.

## 8. Contact
